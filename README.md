# Rock, Paper, Scissors!
## About

A project built following a TDD approach, using Sinatra and Capybara/RSpec for test-driving, as part of the `individual challenges` for the Makers Academy coding course: https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge-apprenticeships.

This is a simple webapp that lets the user play a game of rock, paper, scissors, in either a single player or two player mode.
